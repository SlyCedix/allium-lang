# allium-lang

This is my LLVM frontend that I can use to test some ideas I've been having
I have no idea if this project will go anywhere or do anything interesting

## todo

This code base will be littered with todos

### language goal

- [x] file ingest
- [ ] kaleidoscope but with some tweaks
- [ ] primitives
  - [ ] integers (doing this as the base types instead of floats like kaleidoscope)
    - [ ] parsing
    - [ ] arithmetic
    - [ ] bit math
  - [ ] structs
  - [ ] pointers
  - [ ] arrays
  - [ ] slices
  - [ ] chars (utf-8 only)
  - [ ] string (char arrays)
- [ ] function pointers
- [ ] lambdas??
- [ ] self hosting
